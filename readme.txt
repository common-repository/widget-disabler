It removes the widgets of deactivated plugins from the sidebars. This is required if some widgets are causing errors that don't let you remove them by yourself.

== Description ==

If you are testing widgets on your WordPress powered blog it sometimes happens that the widget causes errors that make it impossible to remove the widget from the sidebar again. If these errors have bricked your system the only way to get it working again is to deactivate the whole plugin. But if you would like to use some parts of the plugin that are independent of the widget you can't just reactivate the plugin because the widget will be present in the sidebar again. For this reason I wrote a plugin that removes all widgets of deactivated plugins from the sidebars. It'll be availabe on the WordPress site as soon as the new project is approved.

== Installation ==

1. Copy plugin contents to /wp-content/plugins/widget-disabler.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
